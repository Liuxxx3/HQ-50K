## HQ-50K Dataset
HQ-50K is a large-scale image restoration dataset with high-quality images with rich texture details and semantic diversity, which considers the five aspects simultaneously : *Large-Scale*, *High-Resolution*, *Compression Rates*, *Rich texture details* and *Semantic Coverage*.  Additionally, we also offer 1250 test images that span across various semantic categories and frequency ranges. This new benchmark can facilitate detailed and fine-grained performance comparison and analysis.

## Get the Dataset
1. Download the dataset from [HQ-50K](YangQiee/HQ-50K) by [img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset).
2. Generate paired data corresponding to each task [DataPrepare]().
